## Slide Design Requirements

A professional, high-density consulting presentation slide, designed in the style of a top-tier strategy firm (McKinsey/BCG) blended with high-end editorial aesthetics.

### Core Content & Layout:

1. Rich Data Visualization: The slide is populated with complex, precise charts (stacked bar charts, waterfall charts, or line graphs) and detailed data tables with rows and columns.
2. Structured Frameworks: Includes strategic diagrams or 2x2 matrices constructed with thin, clean lines.
3. High Information Density: The layout is sophisticated and multi-column, mimicking an actual business analysis deck, not just an empty cover page.

### Visual Style:

1. Aesthetic: Tech-minimalist but information-heavy. Clean, sharp, and authoritative.
2. Typography: Serif fonts (like Times New Roman) for the main headlines to give a premium financial report feel; clean Sans-serif for chart labels and data numbers.
3. Color Palette: Clean white background. Text is sharp black. Charts and graphical accents use Deep Royal Blue and distinct shades of grey for data hierarchy.
4. Graphics: Use fine hairline borders for tables and precise vector lines for graphs.
